# word-up

A quick first post on the approach and tools I’m using for capturing, processing and sharing my thoughts. 

**Idea capture**

- Slack - I send myself messages to remember ideas. Usually on mobile. Often when I’m doing something else.
- Paper - occasionally I’ll write ideas onto paper. But usually paper is for expanding ideas, mind mapping, or making lists.

**Thought reconciliation and writing**

Notion is my default “deep writing” tool. I’ll be using this to organise and write more deeply things I’ve jotted down.  I already write notes from meeting and calls I have here, so it feels very natural.  I’m  considering switching to Roam as I like the “networked ideas” concept, but will stick with Notion for now.

**Publish**

This is the thing I’m bad at. Writing up my thoughts for others, is something I’m bad at. My colleagues sometimes like reading my raw notes but I’ve also had complaints that I don’t write up my thoughts enough for my team. 

Posting will be via Github pages. This gives track changes via Git. 

**The edit - always WIP**

Part of this writing exercise is to see an evolution of thought. I’ll be editing and rewriting much of the content.  You can keep track of changes [here](https://github.com/anoneous/anoneous.github.io/commits/main).

**Distribution**

Starting with [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Anoneous). Thinking about Substack or email format.
